# ===== Summary of File Usage in GitHub Workflows =====
# - The entire `main.tf` is used during both `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` steps.
# - Variables referenced here (e.g., `var.resource_group_name`) should be supplied in the 
#   `terraform.tfvars` file (non-sensitive values), which is checked into Git.
# - Sensitive credentials such as Cosmos DB keys and Storage Account keys are NOT stored
#   in `tfvars` but are handled via internal outputs (not printed in development), or managed
#   securely using Azure Key Vault (recommended for production).
# - The GitHub Actions workflow uses secrets (`AZURE_CREDENTIALS` and `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`) to authenticate and
#   run these Terraform commands, referencing both this file and the `tfvars`.
# - The `plan` job generates an execution plan file, which the `apply` job later consumes.
# - Terraform outputs (e.g., endpoint URLs and the Function App URL) are captured post-apply
#   to populate the GitHub step summary or to support downstream deployment steps.
